# dlib - the lib for deep learning research

`dlib` is a collection of tools, utility functions, and modules that I have found useful for deep learning research, mostly biased towards training LLMs.

## Installation

The easiest way to use `dlib` is to simply copy all files into a root-level `dlib/` folder in your project. The requirements are listed in `requiremnts.txt` but most of these are already present when doing NLP with `torch`. 

## Usage
Most scripts and functions have docstrings that explain their usage.
